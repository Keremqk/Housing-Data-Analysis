# Cook County Housing Data Analysis
This project, completed for UC Berkeley's Data 100 course, analyzes over 500,000 property records from Cook County, Illinois, to understand factors influencing home prices.

## Tools
Python • Pandas • NumPy • Jupyter • Linear Regression

## Project Summary
- Cleaned and merged raw housing data from the Cook County Assessor's Office  
- Engineered features (e.g., indicator variable for high-value neighborhoods)  
- Built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict sale prices  
- Explored fairness implications inspired by the Cook County property assessment scandal, where biased models contributed to unequal taxation  

## Takeaway
This project taught me how technical modeling decisions have real-world impacts, especially when data-driven systems affect communities and equity.
