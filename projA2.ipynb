    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project A1, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models.\n",

We will use the training set to fit our model's parameters and the validation set to evaluate how well our model will perform on unseen data drawn from the same distribution.

Then, use these arrays to index into `data` to create your final `train` and `validation` `DataFrame`s. To ensure that your code matches the solution, use the first 80% as the training set and the last 20% as the validation set. Remember, the values you use to partition `data` must be integers!\n",

    "In Project A1, you wrote a few functions that added features to the dataset. Instead of calling them manually one by one each time, it is best practice to encapsulate all of this feature engineering into one \"pipeline\" function. Defining and using a pipeline reduces all the feature engineering to just one function call and ensures that the same transformations are applied to all data.  Below, we combined some functions into a single helper function that outputs `X` and `Y` for the first model above. Try to understand what this function does! \n",

    "**Note 1:** We have automatically imported staff implementations of the functions you wrote in Project A1. These functions are `remove_outliers`, `add_total_bedrooms`, `find_expensive_neighborhoods`, `add_in_expensive_neighborhood`, and `ohe_roof_material`. You are welcome to copy over your own implementations if you would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** The staff implementation provided for `remove_outliers` is slightly different from what you did in Project A1. Here `remove_outliers` is exclusive for the bounds whereas in Project A1, it was inclusive for the bounds. `remove_outliers` will only output values strictly greater than the lower bound and strictly smaller than the upper bound. Feel free to still use your original implementation of the function; it shouldn't affect your score if it was done correctly but may slightly change your approach to `q5f`."

Attempts will not carry over across days, so we recommend planning ahead to make sure you have enough time to finetune your model! \n",

    "- **If you are running into memory issues, restart the kernel and only run the cells you need to.** The cell below (question cell) contains most to all of the imports necessary to successfully complete this portion of the project, so it can be completed independently code-wise from the remainder of the project, and you do not need to rerun the cell at the top of this notebook. The autograder will have more than 4GB of memory, so you will not lose credit as long as your solution to Question 5 is within the total memory (4GB) limits of Datahub. By default, we reset the memory and clear all variables using `%reset -f`. If you want to delete specific variables, you may also use `del` in place of `%reset -f%`. For example, the following code will free up memory from data used for older models: `del training_val_data, test_data, train, validation, X_train_m1, X_valid_m1, X_train_m2, X_valid_m1`. Our staff solution can be run independently from all other questions, so we encourage you to do the same to make debugging easier.\n",
    "- **If you need the data again after deleting the variables or resetting, you must reload them again from earlier in the notebook.**\n",
    "- You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",
    "- You MUST remove any additional new cells you add before submitting to Gradescope to avoid any autograder errors. \n",
    "- **You can only submit your test set prediction CSV file to Gradescope up to 4 times per day. Start early!** In the case that you are approved for an extension, you will be granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended.\n",

You will be predicting `Log Sale Price` on the data stored in `cook_county_contest_test.csv`. To determine your model's RMSE on the test set, you will submit the predictions made by your model to Gradescope. There, we will run checks to see what your test RMSE is by considering (hidden) true values for the `Sale Price`. We will delog/exponentiate your prediction on Gradescope to compute RMSE and use this to score your model. Before submitting to Gradescope, make sure that your predicted values can all be delogged (i.e., if one of your `Log Sale Price` predictions is 60, it is too large; $e^{60}$ is too big!)\n",

Plan your time to ensure that you can adjust your model as necessary, and please test your model's performance using cross-validation before making any submissions.** For more on cross-validation, check [Lecture 16](https://ds100.org/fa24/lecture/lec16/). In particular, the [Lecture 16 notebook](https://data100.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDS-100%2Ffa24-student&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ffa24-student%2F%2Flecture%2Flec16%2Flec16.ipynb&branch=main&redirects=1) may be helpful here. **Furthermore, feel free to use the cross validation implementation done in Lab 8 to test your model.** You can also reference what you did in previous questions when creating training and validation sets and seeing how your model performs.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately —— that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. Fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness but also what fairness —— and justice —— means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL —— a suburb in Cook County —— as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n"
